# Regierungschecker.de
Regierungschecker.de is a OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) research platform designed to track and verify commitments made by political parties and governments. Our demo version currently focuses on the German Bundestag, helping you assess whether promises were kept or broken.

## Demo 
You can try it out for yourself at [regierungschecker.de](https://regierungschecker.de)

## ðŸš§ Open Source? Not Yet â€“ But Weâ€™re Working On It!
Weâ€™re actively working on establishing the legal and economic framework to release Regierungschecker as open source - please stay tuned. In the meantime, you can give this repository a star if you want to be notified about any changes.
